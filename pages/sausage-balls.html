    <h1>Sausage Balls</h1>
    <p>
        These are my personal favorites! Sausage balls 
        remind me of Christmas time with the family. 

        
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1lb of your choice of sausage</li>
        <li>2 cups of biscuit baking mix</li>
        <li>1lb of shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>
        Preheat oven to 350. While the oven is preheating pour the biscuit mix into a large mixing bowl.
        next add the sausage then the cheese.
        I prefer to use my hands for this however you can use a small mixer. Mix everything 
        until you get an even mix with all your Ingredients. Then roll out quarter size balls
        placing them on parchment paper about 2 inches apart. Once the pan is full 
        put them in the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes.
